# Handwritten Digits Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Description 📝

This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify handwritten digits. The model is trained on the scikit-learn `digits` dataset and evaluated based on its accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the dataset.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used is the **Digits dataset**, which is included in the `scikit-learn` library. It consists of 1,797 samples of handwritten digits, where each digit is represented by an 8x8 pixel image.
